 - [ ] &nbsp;  “, Orange”
 - [ ] &nbsp;  “Orange”
 - [X] &nbsp;  “Apple”
 - [ ] &nbsp;  "Apple, Orange”

## Answer

Option C is correct.

With this particular set of arguments, you are sending in the data to the market workflow.  No data is coming back out.  If you put a writelin within the Market Workflow after the assignment, you would get “Apple, Orange”
