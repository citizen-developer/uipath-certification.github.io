Question:  Which wildcard characters can be used while editing a selector?

 - [ ] &nbsp;  % and !
 - [ ] &nbsp;  % and _
 - [X] &nbsp;  ? and *
 - [ ] &nbsp;  _ and *

## Answer

Option C is correct.

This should look familiar and for good reason, these are pretty standard.  Just like in DOS the ? (zero or one unknown character) and * (zero or more unknown characters) are the same.  The other choices don’t have any meaning for selector’s
