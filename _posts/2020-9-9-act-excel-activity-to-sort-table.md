<h1>Which Activity?</h1>

Question: When using an Excel Application Scope activity, which activity should be used to sort a table directly in an .xlsx file?

- [ ] &nbsp;  Sort Data Table 
- [ ] &nbsp;  Get Table Range
- [ ] &nbsp;  Select Range 
- [x] &nbsp;  Sort Table

## Answer

Answer: D 

If you have loaded the spreadsheet into a table and wanted to sort that, then Sort Data Table is the correct answer
Since we are sorting the spreadsheet itself, Sort Table is the correct activity.  
Get Table Range and Select Range do not have any sorting capabilities.
