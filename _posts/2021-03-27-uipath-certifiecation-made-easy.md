# How to prep for the UiPath Certification exam

UiPath RPA Developer Associate Exam is a tricky one. Though the certification requires 70% passing mark and consists of multi choice questions, it is not a straight-forward test. In this document I will take you through the steps that I have followed to prepare for the exam and how they turned out to be beneficial in helping me score 84% in the actual test.
•	Practical knowledge over Theoretical knowledge: I personally feel one can learn relatively more by implementing a task (be it any skill) than just reading about it. I am not saying that the theory is not important, but rather theory only makes sense when you know what is going around. So, a research project that automates excel and pdf activities – it helped me learn most of the concepts and get an overview about how UiPath works. I would recommend implementing the project in linear approach and using REFramework – and then evaluate the advantages and disadvantages. The key advantage of REFramework is I got to learn the workflow, name conventions and how passing arguments through different workflows work.
•	Practice Test:
Now that I had practical knowledge about how UiPath and its tools work. It was the right time to evaluate myself and to have knowledge about the areas that I have missed out or not comfortable with. I would suggest not being demotivated with the score you get in this phase because that is what the entire purpose of the first practice test is.
•	UiPath Academy:
Once I have noted down the areas where I have score low in the practice test, I started learning from the tutorials for the concerned topics. For me, it was Debugging and UI Selectors. I have gone through all the course material multiple times until I was comfortably passing all the Final Assessments in UiPath Academy’s Each section (RPA starter course, RPA Developer Track). I feel that through this phase, making notes is important.
•	Online Material and other Mocks:
Dumps – This website helped a lot with their resources of different type of question and along the way there are small mock tests where you can analyze your knowledge. The important factor that I would suggest this website to other candidates is that the Certification Exam has many poorly worded questions that could be ambiguous (I mean the questions are worse) – Going through such questions beforehand could save from losing marks in the exam, due to the incompetence of test maker. Overlooking this might cost you $150, trust me you don not want your sensible thinking to make you lose marks.
•	More Practice Tests:
At this point, I was pretty much comfortable with most of the concepts and now, I must be comfortable with the time constraint. I suggest googling for any possible free practice tests to test your knowledge. You might ask “when do you feel you’re ready?”, the answer would be anytime where you are easily scoring >80% consistently in various practice tests.
