<h1UiPath DataRow Objects</h1>

Question:  Which activity can be used to retrieve the value from a certain cell, from a DataRow object?

 - [ ] &nbsp;  Read Cell
 - [ ] &nbsp;  Write Cell
 - [X] &nbsp;  Get Row Item
 - [ ] &nbsp;  Remove Data Row

## Answer

Option C is correct.

The correct answer is C.  Read Cell and Write Cell are activities that work with an Excel spreadsheet directly.  Removing Data Row will only remove the data, it will not read it.  Get Row Item will pull the info in the specific column, which is a particular cell.
