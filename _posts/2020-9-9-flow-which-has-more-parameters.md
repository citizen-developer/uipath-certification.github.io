<h1>Which has more parameters</h1>

Question: Which Activity uses the least amount of Parameters?

- [ ] &nbsp;  SMTP 
- [X] &nbsp;  Outlook 
- [ ] &nbsp;  POP3 
- [ ] &nbsp;  Mail

## Answer

Options b is correct.

The outlook activity has the least amount of parameters.  SMTP and POP3 require user name, password, port number and mail server to operate correctly.  
Outlook can get all that information from windows.  Mail is the all encompassing container that holds these three so not really an activity
