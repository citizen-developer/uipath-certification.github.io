Question:  What status does a job have when a schedule is triggered in Orchestrator, but there are no available robots to execute it?

 - [ ] &nbsp;  In Progress
 - [X] &nbsp;  Pending
 - [ ] &nbsp;  New
 - [ ] &nbsp;  Waiting

## Answer

Option B is correct.

If there are no robots available, the status is pending.  Although it is actually waiting for a robot, that is not the name of the status
