Question:  What describes the file access level needed when using the Read Range Workbook activity?

 - [ ] &nbsp;  Works only with .xls files and Excel does not need to be installed
 - [ ] &nbsp;  Works only with .xlsm files and Excel must be installed
 - [X] &nbsp;  Works with .xlsx files and Excel does not need to be installed
 - [ ] &nbsp;  Works with .xls and .xlsx files, and Excel must be installed

## Answer

Option C is correct.

One of the great features about the Read Range Workbook activity is that it does not need the Excel to actually be installed to work. So it can take .xlsx files and the developer can use the data and even create another .xlsx file all without needing the Microsoft Excel program itself.

Although, for troubleshooting purposes, having Excel installed is highly recommended
