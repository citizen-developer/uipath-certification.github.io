Question:  What is an argument?

 - [ ] &nbsp;  A variable
 - [X] &nbsp;  An input/output parameter of the workflow
 - [ ] &nbsp;  A variable type
 - [ ] &nbsp;  A specific activity

## Answer

Option B is correct.

Arguments can be used like variables but variables cannot be used like arguments.  One of the features of Arguments is they have direction and can be used to pass information between workflows
