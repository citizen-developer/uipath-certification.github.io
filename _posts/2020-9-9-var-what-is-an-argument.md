<h1>What is an argument in UiPath?</h1>

Question:  Which of the following best describes a UiPath Argument?

 - [ ] &nbsp;  A variable
 - [X] &nbsp;  An input/output parameter of the workflow
 - [ ] &nbsp;  A variable type
 - [ ] &nbsp;  A specific activity

## Answer

Option B is correct.

Arguments in UiPath Studio can be used like variables but variables cannot be used like arguments.  One of the features of Arguments is they have direction and can be used to pass information between workflows
