Question:  Can you store a Selector in a variable?

 - [X] &nbsp;  Only within a String variable
 - [ ] &nbsp;  Only within a UiElement variable
 - [ ] &nbsp;  No
 - [ ] &nbsp;  No, unless within a flowchart

## Answer

Option A is correct.

You can use selectorâ€™s anywhere, within a sequence or flowchart but they must be stored in a string variable as they are strings themselves.  They are within the attribute of a tag so they must be string
