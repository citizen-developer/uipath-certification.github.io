## UiPath Stock Valuation

_Editors Note: We were interested in doing research and analysis on the UiPath stock IPO (PATH), but felt we couldn't do much better than this video from Mr. FIRED Up Wealth. Here is a mildly edited transcript of the video. Enjoy._

What's up guys. Eric here, Mr. Fired-up wealth. If I told you that there was a robotic process automation company, that's really best of breed that might be coming out on IPO and you can actually own shares of the company. Would you want to learn more about the business? Well, that's exactly what we're going to cover today without further ado let's get started.

## What is RPA with UiPath?

Okay. The first thing we're going to do is we're going to talk about Robotic Process Automation, also known as RPA because that's really what UiPath. Is all about. So robotic process automation is the technology that allows anyone today to configure computer software or a robot to emulate and integrate the actions of human interacting within digital systems to execute.

Uh, business process, RPA robots utilize the user interface to capture data and manipulate applications, just like humans. Do they interpret trigger responses and communicate with other systems in order to perform on a vast variety of repetitive tasks? Only substantially better and RPA, a software robot never sleeps and makes zero mistakes.

Now this is a cartoon kind of from their website that goes through and shows you the story behind UiPath and why RPA is so powerful. So important. It talks about, you know, why, why RPA needs to be adopted by businesses. And it really comes down to your employees, especially office workers. More and more are just bogged down with mundane tasks with data entry.

## RPA Market Insights

And they're not really focused on what they're getting paid for. And so how can we make that process more automated through robots so that our employees can be happy and productive because quite frankly, Who wants to just go to the office and data entry all day. And there, a lot of times these people are paid a lot of money, you know, $35 an hour or more to do data entry.

And a lot of it is, you know, things that robots RPA can basically do in an automated fashion for a lot less money, especially when you think of. They call it the return on robot investment rrr, but here's Glenn and he's talking, you know, Hey, you need to do an expense report. So if you're in sales, you have to do an expense report.

Every time you travel and you need to, you know, go on to concur or whatever, you know, whatever products you guys use and you have to fill out that expense report and it takes time. And it takes away from that salesperson actually focused on their job, which is selling. This is their, their whole strategy is discover, build, manage, run, engage, and measure.

And you'll see that later on in the video, but this really comes down to. Trying to be more productive, more effective, more efficient, and really happier workforce. So this is a quick intro into UiPath and what RPA is all about.

Okay. So how can RPA helped me? And this is really from a perspective from UiPath, trying to sell this to a business, but as an investor, it's important to understand how UiPath can win business, how they can grow. So. How can RPA help me rapid return on investment enhance processes, better customer experience, eliminate repeat work, improve service delivery, enhanced ability to manage your employees.

## UiPath Stock Value Proposition

Reduction of costs, increased compliance. Non-invasive technology, scalability, and flexibility. Any sized business can use it. And insight and analytics, which is very important, especially in today's age. These are all very good reasons why you might want to buy or invest in UiPath if you are a business.

And they're important reasons for us to understand as investors, this infographic really shows you a little bit more detail about the discover, the build, the manager's running engaged. So when you think of discover. Discover automation opportunities powered by AI and your people build. You're going to build automations quickly so that, you know, you want to do this fast.

You want to make something real quick. You want to do a quick and simple automation. You're going to manage, deploy and optimize automation, uh, at enterprise scale. So you want to build a scale up for any size organization. You can run. Automations through robots that will work with applications and data, of course engage people and robots as one team for seamless process collaboration.

## RPA Stock Investment Facts

That's very powerful, quick facts about UiPath. This is good information. So they've been a leader in every Gartner magic quadrant, Forrester wave and Everest peak matrix for RPA. So they are considered best of breed. Read number one in all major independent user review sites for RPA, including gardener, peer sites.

Trust radius all the big ones. Right? So they're number one in all major independent reviews. They're on the disruptor. 50 from CNBC they're on the Forbes, AI 50, they're the only RPA provider named to the Forbes, AI 50 in 2020. So next I want to show you some quick infographics here. This here is the magic quadrant.

You probably see it quite a bit. If you follow especially software and in SAS. You know, Gardner does these magic quadrants really to show you the best of breed. And so you can see in the top right-hand side of that magic quadrant, the leader's UiPath is the top. You see other companies in there like Microsoft, you see other companies like SAP, there's that blue prism in there, but a UiPath is really considered best of breed.

## Analysis of UiPath IPO Price

They have 40 offices around the world. They were actually created originally. And Romania, and they now are headquartered in New York city, but you can see all the different offices. They're very global. Now this is a cool infographic. I got from a white paper. This is from Gardner research and it says just a few automations can save 20 minutes of work per person, daily, enabling 10,000 employees with a software robot will save more than $30 million a year.

Based on an average salary of $35 an hour. So as a potential investor, we want to do as much due diligence as we possibly can. We want to know what the company does, what the features are of UI pass. So this slide here is going to cover the features. For example, hosting options. It can be hosted in cloud environments or virtual terminals application compatibility.

They offer a high range of applications to work with, which include both web and desktop applications. Essentially  repository. This feature really helps with handling all the robots simultaneously at the same time. By users. So a user can come in and control the robots and make them do different things with, with a couple of clicks of the mouse security offers auto log-in feature to run the robots, advanced screen scraping solution.

Now scraping solution. It really works with any application. So you can use net Java, flash, PDF, legacy SAP. All of them really with absolute accuracy. And if you, if you're not familiar with what that terminology is, it doesn't really matter that that much per se, but what you need to take from that is that the solution really works with many different applications.

### UiPath RPA Tooling

So it's important to realize it's a reliable tool for modeling business processes or processes, depending on how you want to pronounce it. The UiPath studio offers automation excellence with the help. Of model business processes, level of scalability and robustness. There's really two major bullets there, effective debugging and exception handling mechanisms.

And then also artificial intelligence, our AI handling, which really handles day to day applications like your outlook, your Excel, your PDF, et cetera. So some of those are some of the key features to UiPath. All right. So how does RPA work? How does robotic process automation work? RPA robots are capable of mimicking many, if not all human user actions, they log in applications.

They can move files and folders. They can copy and paste data. They can fill in forms, extract structured, even semi-structured data from documents, scraped browsers, and much more. So let's look at that. This is just a quick infographic on their website, logging in the application. We mentioned these right.

Connect the system APIs, though. That's really critical when you think of. You know, a SAS solution, a cloud type SAS environment with within large complex organizations, you have an enterprise software solution you might use best of breed and have lots of different products that have to communicate to each other.

And so connecting the API APIs can help with that as many, as well, as many other reasons, it can help with an organization, but, you know, RPAs can copy and paste data so that people don't have to do it. It saves them time. They can move. Data from files and folders that can move files and folders. They can extract process, extract, and process structured.

And even semi-structured information from PDF documents, from your emails, from forms, they can put that into a central repository. They can put it into a database they can read and write to databases. They can open emails and attachments for you automatically. They can scrape data from the web. They can make calculations.

There's a lot of things that you can do with these RPA, with these robots. Something really simple. If you're in our discord, if you're, if you're not, you can join patron and join discord, but we have robots in there that essentially do tasks. Like when a new user comes in, you have to accept the rules.

That's all automated through Robots. And we've got different, several different robots in there that do different things that can play music for you. It can pull up charts, it can, uh, provide information about specific, you know, commands that you give it. Some of that's even automated though, where it just post the rules to the group every 12 hours and so on.

#### How UiPath Robots Work

So that's just one simple example of how, you know, <a href="https://www.theserverside.com/blog/Coffee-Talk-Java-News-Stories-and-Opinions/Create-your-first-RPA-robot-to-UiPath-Orchestrator-tutorial">RPA robots</a> can work. So you think of like chat bots, you think of, you know, lots of different ways that you can use robotic process automation. So that. You know, the admins like for discord or for the employees that accompany don't have to sit at a desk all day and do this stuff manually.

It takes a lot of time. You can use that time to focus on more productive, more effective, more efficient things for your organization. Another cool infographic from that same white paper Gartner coined the term hyper automation to describe how the combination of robotic process automation, RPA, and disruptive technologies such as artificial intelligence, AI.

And machine learning process, mining decision management, and more can be used together in an end to end <a href="https://www.theserverside.com/video/Get-automated-with-this-RPA-and-UiPath-tutorial-for-beginners">RPA automated solution.</a> This is from Everest group right here. I think this is good information. What processes are relevant RPA and it shows you the different industries here on the left-hand side. So you've got banking, insurance, healthcare, manufacturing high-tech and telecomm energy and utilities.

And it's talking about all the different things you can use it for. So industry specific processes here and up here, it says potential for RPA low to high. So this dark blue is kind of low potential for RPA. This, this orange color, the bright orange color is high potential for RPA. And you can see that there, you know, you can see in banking there's, um, there's quite a bit for the accounts receivable, the accounts payable, the general ledger and manufacturing as well.

#### UiPath IPO Price Financials

You can see the different areas. So. Uh, banking financials, they have here card activation. Could it be something that robots could help with? Um, RPA frauds claim discovery is another one insurance. You've got claims processing and new business preparation. You think of lemonade insurance. They use like AI chat bots and there's, there's quite a few different insurance industry or Sharon's companies in the insurance industry that use claims processing bots like that.

So that's pretty common. And this is. Something that there's probably a lot more potential, um, growth in that area, for sure. Reports, automation system or, uh, reconciliation for healthcare and manufacturing. They got the bomb, the bill of materials, generation and high tech and telecom. They have service order management and quality reporting and then energy and utilities that says account setup and meter reading validation.

I think this is important just to have an understanding of maybe different industries and how RPA. May apply or may be useful to those specific industries. This one's also pretty cool UiPath platform. Hyper automation combines a leading RPA solution with full suite of capabilities. Some of the highlights use AI to analyze backend systems and application logs.

Process document data enable all employees that chip in is what they call citizen developers. Gain more control and flexibility over attended robots, centralized automation, applied process mining apply AI to your robots to automate more. SAS solution also opens the door to RPA for all businesses, which is very powerful and a great business opportunity for a company like UiPath.

Real quick more information. This is just from Wikipedia, but UiPath. I mentioned earlier, it was founded in Romania. It was founded in 2005 and it was actually founded in Bucharest, Romania, and later they, they opened offices in London, New York city, Bangalore, Paris, Singapore, Washington, DC, and Tokyo.

They're headquartered now in New York city. If you can see here, the growth 2017, they had 590 employees. And then move the headquarters to New York, to be closer to, to international customer base. In 2016, they had a hundred customers and that Rose to 700 customers in 2017 and then in 2019 UiPath across 5,000 customers worldwide.

So this is a pretty impressive growth story. They've grown very quickly. They've they've had accelerated growth over the last few years. UiPath was also ranked first and Deloitte technology fast 500. There's a bunch of different ones on here. The financial times, 1000 number two overall. You know, I mentioned the CNBC disruptor 50 UiPath was right.

#### Bloomberg UiPath IPO Insights

Number three again for the second consecutive year on the Forbes cloud, a 102,020. And in December 17th, 2020 <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/profile/company/1506427D:US">Bloomberg reported UiPath</a> filed confidentially for an initial public offering, which is why we're talking about the, the, the company and the, and the potential stock. Cause it might be something that we could look into as an investment for a portfolio.

Now funding. I won't focus too much on the earlier years up here, but it is important to realize this is fairly new. February 1st, 2021 UiPath raised $750 million in series F funding at a post-money valuation of $35 billion. Now. They originally was in the, I think $20 billion range now 35 billion, like a lot of these IPOs, they get higher and higher and higher.

So this is getting pretty expensive. And when you look at, you know, the price to sales ratios and things like that, but they are best of breed. There are a few other companies that compete. I think you'll see more and more businesses get into this space. I'm going to show you what I mean here in a second.

So this is older information and it talks about that they are valued at $20 billion. As I mentioned, you can see right here. <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/26/uipath-files-s-1-for-ipo.html">CNBC reported UiPath</a> had 360 million in annual revenue at the time with more than 6,300 customers. So you can see it grew from 5,000 to 6,300. And customers include Amazon and Verizon, which I think is pretty important.

UI pass AI automation platform yeah. Is meant to automate millions of repetitive mind-numbing tasks for businesses and governments. All over the world, improving productivity, customer experience and employee job satisfaction. Very well said. Gardner expects worldwide robotic process automation, RPA software revenue to reach about $2 billion this year.

That's up 20% year over year and growth at double digits through 2024. So di decent growth there. The key driver for RPA projects. This is a quote. The key driver for RPA projects is their ability to improve process quality, speed, and productivity. Each of which increases is increasingly important as organizations try to meet the demands of cost reduction during COVID-19 and that's from gardener.

Now what's the competition look like? Cause that's important. So Microsoft has actually made a strong RPA push in recent years, they added to their capabilities. Um, it's called power automate solution. And in 2019 they acquired an RPA startup called soft motive. Also IBM acquired a Brazilian RPA company.

That company was called WDG automation and then SAP. These are big companies, of course, launch it's intelligent robotic process automation solution. Now one company to keep in mind if you're doing due diligence and you're interested in investing in this space is going to be this blue prism. So they compete UiPath competes with blue prism in a recent bullish call seeking alpha contributor, Coretta advisors recommended buying blue prism ahead of the UiPath.

Um, IPO seeing blue prism as valued at 50% discount to where UiPath is likely to list as per perspective, price to sales multiple. So. You know, obviously the, uh, it's expensive, but a lot of times as you pay, you pay up for best of breed. So this is going to be a, like a lot of these IPOs where it feels like it's too expensive, then it probably just keeps going higher.

And I'm not saying you should just necessarily buy it just because the price is going higher, but keep in mind that this is probably going to be. In demand when it does come out, here's a quick comparison of UiPath, blue prism and automation anywhere. And you can see all 2021 revenue estimates are based on consensus growth.

We of 36% year over year for blue prism, you can see 2018 UiPath. Is one 55 revenue, blue prism, 71, 2019. You know, these UiPath basically double, but they both, they all have good growth. Yeah. And then a UiPath here is four and 26 versus one 79 and then five 79 and two 44. So pretty good growth there. Um, in terms of revenue, it looks like 579.

Million dollars. So, you know, you can take that easily to get a price to sales ratio. So on valuation, if you use the F Y 21 revenue estimates, here are the falling price of sales. So UiPath. The market cap based on, on series E in July, which is obviously different now, but that was $10.2 billion. It's going to be, as we mentioned earlier, a lot higher blue prism, much smaller at about 2.2 billion.

#### UiPath Price Multiple

Now, UiPath based on this number was a 17.6 price of sales. Multiple. This gives you some good numbers here. Blue prism is only a nine, so this could be an opportunity. It does trade OTC though. So keep that in mind. But UiPath. So, you know, at $10 million, if the sales multiple is 17.6, you know, if the, uh, the market cap ends up being $30 billion, you basically, you know, take that time street.

It's, it's pretty expensive. It's getting up there to like the CrowdStrike and Datadog type price to sales, but it does have good growth too. You can see one 55 to 300, 300 to four 26, four 26 to five 79. So it's going to be interesting, you know, obviously there's going to be. Risks. Um, I'm going to show you some other information here in a second of why, you know, it could be a risk reward play with UiPath.

Here's another good document. It talks about RPA as the market overvalued UiPath here. Um, you know, you've got valuations, you've got revenue estimates, and you can see that, uh, blue prism is also in there and automation anywhere. So, if you look at the growth, you can see that overall growth for RPA. You know, it's, it's, it's pretty impressive, you know, 90%, 84, 71, 70, 30, 20, and it's got this revenue multiple here and you can see, you know, it's actually going to go lower as they grow.

Right. So that's why you're paying up a lot of times, you know, in advance on a stock RPA software, um, market value, sensitivity analysis. This is showing. Some stats there in terms of growth and the revenue multiples, you know, it's going to get better with time and who's leading the charge. There's some good graphs here talking about, you know, public sector.

And I'll put the link in here. So you can go take a look at this, but I could spend an hour going through all this stuff. This is what I want to point out though. A winner take all market. The future of RPA market will be defined by its ability to break into more use cases with deeper business integration.

There's a real opportunity to cross the chasm and deliver useful low code systems, a subject matter expert in business areas that have strong potential to drive change. The idea of hyper automation is a buzz, a worthy word, but it has meaning. Companies that bring RP together will pro with process mining and machine intelligence, which is really what UiPath does.

#### Invest in UiPath IPO

And I think they do the best at it. Um, that basically is going to have great potential. So, so long as organizational stovepipes can be broken down, but process data and analytics at the core to drive decision-making and change. In other words, whoever can break this. You know, is gonna going to be the best of breed winner takes all type.

Um, and the winners are most likely to be the companies that have already carved out an early lead. So it talks about, um, there's not even much room for big software players, such as Microsoft SAP. The problem is that Microsoft and SAP both have an incremental view of the market and bundle RPAs as a checkoff rather than giving it a high priority.

And you're seeing this more and more in like the cloud and SAS space. Where people are, you know, taking a bunch of best of breed products and putting them into one solution that works best for the organization. And this is kind of alluding to that same thing where someone might go with the UiPath, cause it's really the best of breed and it can integrate so easily now with the rest of, you know, the enterprise system.

So organizations that really want to benefit from so-called hyper automations will be leaning heavily on software from specialists who have the vision, resources, culture, and focus to drive digital process transformation. Number one, we'll make a lot of money. Number two. We'll do. Okay. And everyone else will struggle with profits.

So what does that tell you? I think it tells me that you probably have a winner with UiPath based on their track record, based on what the analysts think of their, their products, you know, the, the magic quadrants thing like that. So. Uh, you know, I actually think UiPath is an amazing opportunity. It's going to be very, very expensive, but I think it's an amazing opportunity that really could be the best of breed and kind of the leader of the pack.

According to this article, it could be, you know, one company takes all and that company might just be UiPath. Hey guys, thanks for watching.
