<h1>PDF activities not listed in activities panel, how to access them?</h1>

Question:  If the PDF activities are not listed in your activities panel, how can you add them?

 - [ ] &nbsp;  Those activities are not available
 - [X] &nbsp;  You have to install pdf activities using the Manage Packages features
 - [ ] &nbsp;  Try to find a different but similar activity
 - [ ] &nbsp;  Reboot and they will appear

## Answer

Option B is correct.

Whenever an activity is not available, you would need to go to the Manage Packages feature and install them using that method. It should go without saying that the other options should be obviously incorrect now.
The Manage Packages feature has three areas to it: Local, Marketplace and Official.

The Local area: These are packages stored locally on your machine but may have not been made available within your project.
The Markeplace: This is where developers such as yourself can create their own packages and make them available to everyone connecting to the marketplace.
The Official area: These are the packages that are officially supported by UiPath, you can get the latest packages as well as test out Beta versions of new packages.
