Question:  <img src="https://github.com/uipath-certification/uipath-certification.github.io/blob/master/assets/Arguments%20-In-In_Cart2%20.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="UiPath, split">

 - [ ] &nbsp;  “, Orange”
 - [ ] &nbsp;  “Orange”
 - [ ] &nbsp;  “Apple”
 - [X] &nbsp;  "Apple, Orange”

## Answer

Option D is correct.

When the workflow Market is invoked, Fruit was sent into In_Cart. We then kept the value and added “, Orange”.  Direction of the argument matters!
