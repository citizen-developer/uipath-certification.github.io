Question:  Which UiPath Studio panel can be used to change the scope of a variable?

 - [X] &nbsp;  Variables pass the data between activities in the same workflow.  Arguments manage the data only inside an activity in the same workflow
 - [ ] &nbsp;  Projects
 - [ ] &nbsp;  Outline
 - [ ] &nbsp;  Locals

## Answer

Option A is correct.

Self-explanatory.  Project shows all the dependencies and other XAML/JSON files connected with the project.  Outline shows the structure of the current project. Locals show the variables/arguments and their values in use during debugging.
