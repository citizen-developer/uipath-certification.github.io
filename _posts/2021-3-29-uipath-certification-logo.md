# UiPath Certification Logo: Download and Usage
_Written by RPA Certified Associate Developer Sal Pece_

I conduct RPA Developer jobs interviews for a large healthcare organization in the US. Beside the usual RPA and UiPath Fundamentals, SQL, and common developer skills questions, we explicitly require UiPath that you obtain your RPA Associate certification. 

I recommend adding the UiPath certification logo to the top of your resume.

Remember that displaying the UiPath certification logo IS NOT enough. Please include the Verification Code from your digital certification certificate as well.  Employers can quickly use the following site to validate your credentials.
