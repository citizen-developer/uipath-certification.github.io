## Second H2
Data scraped the latest news, including timestamps from CNBC. I open up UI path. Then I click data scraping. I now need to define a pattern. So I click next select the first timestamp, then select the second element. So I click next and click the second timestamp. Click next. I click extract, correlated data, select the first news.

Click next, select the second news. Then I click next and I click finish. I click no here. Then I go over to activities and search for a right range. Choose the one under workbook and drag it in. First paste in your workbook path of your Excel sheet in quotation marks like this, then in data table, press control space and choose to Excel data table.

That's the output from up here now, just take it headers and we can run the data screaming robot, open up your Excel sheet, and there's your data.
