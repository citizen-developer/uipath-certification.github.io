## Second H2

Neuro labs is a computer vision startup with a mission to allow everyone to make use of their images and videos by automatically extracting information from them. But what do we actually mean by object detection? You know, for example, how you embed through like some computer vision to identify elements on the screen, my selectors are not available and your labs, we do the same thing, but for objects in images or videos, Let's see some examples for their cognition in a contained shelves monitoring in a supermarket or cars detection in a parking lot.

And your labs. We want to extend the current pick pickup abilities beyond the screen. This is not possible and feasible without computer vision technology. We, it is expensive and time consuming data. We syntactically generated data more. Did this, both our technology and how to integrate it into your workflows will be presented during our live session on 11th of February.

See you there.
