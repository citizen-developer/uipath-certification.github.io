Question:  What activity can you use to read an entire sheet from an entire excel file?

 - [ ] &nbsp;  Get Value
 - [ ] &nbsp;  Read Cell
 - [X] &nbsp;  Read Range
 - [ ] &nbsp;  Writeln

## Answer

Option C is correct.

The read range will get the entire excel file if the range extends to all the excel file.  Reading Cell does not do that
