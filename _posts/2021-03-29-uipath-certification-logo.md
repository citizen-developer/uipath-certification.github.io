## UiPath Certification Logo: Download and Usage
_Written by RPA Certified Associate Developer Sal Pece_
<hr/>


So, you've passed your UiPath Certification exam and now you're interested in displaying your certification logo prominently on your resume or webpage. But despite searching Google, Bing and DuckDuckGo, you can't figure out where on the UiPath site you go to download UiPath Certification logos. Don't feel bad. You're not alone in your fruitless search.

## Where to download the UiPath Certification Logo

UiPath doesn't put the UiPath Associate logo and the UiPath Developer logo on their site for anyone to just download and include on their resume. You have to _earn_ the right to display the UiPath logo. So the RPA bohemoth doesn't make the file publicly available.

If you want to use the UiPath Certification logo, you must first pass the exam. Then, log into your UiPath Certified Professional account at <a href="https://www.certmetrics.com/uipath/candidate/badge_list.aspx">Certmetrics.com</a> and navigate to the UiPath Badges tab and click on the small UiPath Certification logo. You'll get a pop up window that looks something like this:

### UiPath Logo usage guidelines

* You cannot change the color
