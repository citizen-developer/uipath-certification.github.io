# UiPath & Credential Manager Integration
Hey, I'm Cameron McKenzie, @cameronmcnz on Twitter, and I wanted to talk to you about UiPath Studio and Windows Credentials, and show you how you can integrate your UiPath Studio robots with Windows Credentials Manager for web and application usernames and passwords so you can get those credentials securely and you don't have to handle that private stuff in your code.
