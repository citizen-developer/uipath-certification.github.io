<img src="https://github.com/uipath-certification/uipath-certification.github.io/blob/master/assets/Split2020.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="UiPath, split">

- [X] &nbsp;  {Blank,"0","0"}
- [ ] &nbsp;  {"20","20"}
- [ ] &nbsp;  {"0","0"}
- [ ] &nbsp;  {"20","21"}

## Answer

Options A is correct.

When you use the split function, it will take all the information before and after the split character and that can include nothing.  Also the split character is dropped.
