Question: Which of the following describes the most ideal type of activity to automate with UiPath? 

- [ ] &nbsp;  Multistep process with many decision points with structured data 
- [ ] &nbsp;  Perform Analysis on data and provide 
- [ ] &nbsp;  Varied tasks that rely heavily on user input 
- [x] &nbsp;  Rule-based process with structured data

## Answer

Options d is correct.

The first tasks that should be considered for automation are rule-based processes with structured data.  
Once those have been automated, the other tasks can be automated as well.  
Its not that UiPath cannot automate those processes, itâ€™s the rule-based ones that are the easiest to automate
