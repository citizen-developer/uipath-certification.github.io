</figure>

Hello everyone. And welcome back to my YouTube channel minded businesses. Look at them. And today we are going to talk about RPA certification. So coming straight to the point that many people have asked me this question, and they want to know how and which RBA certification they should select. Now, many times there's a confusion in mind, and most of the people are asking me the question that there are two types of certifications, which you able to provide as are abused certification.

Which are paid certifications, obviously apart from the academical certifications, uh, which is one associate and another is RPA advanced in the, okay, so which one we should do and which one is suitable for our job room? This question has been asked many times that I had to create a video on this so that I can play it for all the questions, all the doubts.

And you can, uh, get a straight up a pointer from this particular video that, which certification that you should do in order to. Uh, you know, justifying your role in your organization. So before wasting time let's get started. So first of all, Uh, if you want to know more about RPA certification of your UiPath, just navigate the wipeout.com/learning/certification.

Okay. You can also navigate to academic naughty wiper.com. And from here, you can navigate to certification where you can look at this lab about certified IP associate. And another one is . Okay. So there are two types of certifications, which you can see here. One is UI RPA and another one you can see here, UI E R D.

Okay, so which one we should complete or which one we should target and why we should start now, if you navigate to academia.dot com, if you login, and if in having a here in certification, you didn't clearly read this out that they have clearly mentioned here. This particular certification, which is you are, you are not certified.

RPS escape is specifically is suitable for RP roles, such as Judy Arvin developer. When you are entering in RP industry, when you are just an entry level developer, or you're a fresher who is joining the organization just as a fresher and wants to achieve some advanced certification. So here you go. As a junior RP developer, you can go ahead.

We can get to our parts certified RPA associate. You can, if you are RPA architect for RP architect, it doesn't, he he's, uh, he's not, uh, you know, uh, asked to have. High level of technical knowledge or core technical knowledge. So RPA architect also can complete the UI part certified RP associate certification solution architects, obviously business analyst.

Yes, because they just have a, they just have to move. What RPA is all about. What part is all about. And without knowing the capabilities of tool, we document the capabilities of a specific RP product. You can't. Uh, you know, uh, phone business, and in this room, you can't justify that. So in order to become an RPM business analyst, you have to compete you at, but certified RPA associate certification.

If you're a college graduate, I just said, if you're a college graduate, you should compete  and others. Okay. Now UI RPA is  and assess their knowledge and skills toward their journey to become. And once I made the Lipper solution architect or RPR perspective, if you are in a journey to become that, if you have just entered the RPA industry from any other industry, then you can get started with the certification and you can start your career with this application, right?

So this is an entry level certification for these many types of job roles. So I hope this is pretty much clear and we will talk about some more points about certified ante associates. So let's navigate through, do I, pat.com/learning that certification? So, if you want to achieve, or if you want to complete this certification, you can see here, it's going to be there.

You can select the exam and you can choose which exam which exam is right for you right now, here is option, which tells you check out free rating on USAA that cannot be sold in order to learn. And in order to repair for RP associates, you don't have to actually attend some classes. So you don't have to do something.

Uh, trainings, you can complete it for free of cost from USAA Academy, which is academy.uipath.com. We just have  dot com and you can check out all this courses. If you click on learning. , I'll talk about this later. So first of all, we'll talk about this one. So if you want to complete, if you want to learn, uh, and if you want to crack this RPA associate exam, then they have given you here part to learn that.

And let's go to that particular period, which opens in order to learn in order to complete the RVP certification associated certification, what training options you want. So either you should have RPS starter pools. Okay. It sounds more of like a dish, but yeah, RBSI tacos are identical. The foundation learning plan, automated automation portion component system calls.

Okay. So these are the three courses that you should. You, you, you have to complete, or you have to learn if you want to prepare yourself, right? So you , so you have to navigate the UI, but the Academy, now you can see, there are many courses here. So if I click on earning bedroom, I can see RPAC doesn't developer, which is in Spanish.

Other than that, because obviously there's a name of the foundation in English. I want  furniture. This is what we need. If we check this RPA never the foundation dining plan review, right? Then you need RPA at a bunch. If you want the complete , then you can complete that one on. So now that is again, business analysts foundation.

So this is be the foundation implementation managers. So, so there are so many of the broader basis. As part of your job, there are courses which they have already given, right. Which are all here. Now. Also, if you go to courses and if you try to find all the courses, you can see here, course language, you can find out what's in your own language.

If I visited English, uh, then if I go to category, I can say RPA started. So this is a course, which is RPA cycle, which you should complete. In order to get cited, RP and understanding of RPM, that that is some new religious. If you want to, you know, choose the new is you can choose that you get just product training, community tutorials, and from products, you can also choose which product you want to learn.

So that a product specific, uh, you know, cravings on courses also have Lebanon Academy. So academics pretty much helpful when you want to learn how you can. Who knows your knowledge. Now, if you are entering in up here as a startup or as a, as a freshman. Okay. And if you, if you want to grow your career instead of joining Academy and start learning from academia from scratch, okay.

Now, if you have completed this three readings, I simply learning you are good people for associate RPA in billable examination. Uh, also there is given all, or you might have completed, but I'll be aligned courses that you have at academic Alliance. If you've been on going to college, but you have dreaming of economic Alliance institution, then you can also be a for this examination.

Oh, other training or self learning sources that cover the subject listed in their documents. Now other trainings and subjects listed in the document would be before the exam. So what are the subjects listed? So hands-on experience what hands on experience you needed. So you need developing an academic process, developing an unedited process, proof of concept and creating some demonstrations experience in resolving application changes or core changes.

And be a code review. So you should at least have hands on experience of all this. Even if you don't have that, doesn't make you, you know, not applicable for the schools, vote for them on that. Even if you don't have this that's okay. But this is something which you, you should have. I mean, you know, it's, it's good to have hands-on experience.

It's good to have, but even if you don't have hands-on experience, don't worry. You can simply go through the courses for my Academy. You can simply learn this practice on your own. Create some boards. You know, after that, once you start learning, once you complete your learning, once you complete your practices, and once you feel that you're ready that click on the exam preparation, click on the RPO associated factors desk and go for the Baptists.

If you crack the practice test in the first school, and if you connect it back to students within middle or higher school, then you go, you're ready. But if you don't like the practices, go back and study the big points, what you have on which questions you have given wrong ones. And then you have failed and try to resolve that.

I don't answer those questions. Okay. So that's all about you. I bought certificate a certified professional, which is, you know, RP associated brain. Now they would talk about what are the more, uh, you know, most special and most important exam, which is RPA advanced developer exam. Okay. Now, when you. When we talk about

because it's not that skin, if you are experienced on the deliver, now let me go get the certification. So, Jim, it looks pretty funny. Okay. So if you have experience or if you have development experience, but you have a couple of projects that look couple of applications of automation today, now you are board certified nine months.

I figure a little bit more on things you need. So the first thing would have written is assesses a deeper level RPX for discovering a robotic enterprise framework. Read this word very carefully. Nobody gets the best framework. Why? Because most of the questions from advanced I'll be direct examination will be based on RPA, robotic enterprise framework, which is nothing, but we call it as our nimble.

If you go to our project, then you can see here in the start. There's always a RD work employed here, right? Nobody in the restaurant. So they are talking about this thing. No, the ability to build complex and efficient RPA solutions independently, right there can be a need for candidates. That's six plus months of working experience in developing RPA solution.

Now this was not written in the associate level examination. Correct? So build whatever that. If you want to correct  examination, then you must have at least six months of experience working as an experienced developer or as they experience our basic issue independently, you can audit a team that you are getting support, where you are automating all a small piece of part.

No, you at least should have six months of individually independent RPA development or RPA work for building experience. Now this. Course is for more technical and technical people, such as RPA developer, solution architect, RPA architect, and others. Now you might have seen  architect is repeating here. Now the audit examination, most for those who are entering in RPA as a solution architect fresher, right.

Or as a new, they are already  in C-sharp and some other technology. They want to jump into RPS solution architect for them. The associate examination is okay. But if you are in, if you are working on RPA as a solution architect since long time, if you're working as an RP architects as long, and then you must have RPA advanced examination, right.

So-so certification. Now, before we go ahead with what are things we need, listen for the document. So this is the document which is provided. For home, crack on what are the tips and tricks for cracking?  exactly right. So this document is pretty big and other than associated, he goes only one page. This is seven pages document.

Okay. So important. Like. We are continuously monitoring interactivities for any science and cheating. The state information. We are aware that a large number of websites who are selling fake exams, charging, substantiate prices for them, we will take immediate action. If you find any real exams have been compromised, please do not spend money or allowance.

Subscribe. So remember, this is authentic, too much authentic. Okay. Now, and then production, they have been working this examination for what is the certification for and why you should crack it. What is the target audience are valedictorians is obviously RPA developer, who is a core technical person in every organization.

The have the RPP and  architect solution designer, RPA engineer solution architect, commissioner. Okay. Now minimum qualified, qualified candidate. Was many of them quantified engineered for this particular insemination. So the minimum qualified candidate is at least six months of experience as RPA developer, but it's rarely completed format of RPO formula training, and at an advanced level with an extensive hands-on experience and technically proficient and possesses the knowledge and skills to work independently.

Okay. So you should be at least capable of independent creating your own waffles, like not your own book, but some automations. Now let's talk about products. So products covered in the exam are 19.10, studio 2019.  they have mentioned specifically products because questions will be based on that. So this reading, this document is really important.

You should know about this. Don't blindly go for the exam. Don't just blindly go for the exam study. Okay. Then what are the exam domains and exam sections? So you, I bought studio, they asked you a lot of questions about you have a studio, you have a studio activities and their properties you, I bought ADI framework is one of the most important questionnaire in this particular examination.

Then darkening classes and objects, advanced functions and LinkedIn troubleshooting, advance orchestra functions. Now the exam topics will be more be based on all these points, which you have mentioned right here. Right? All these things. And they have just explained working within some puppets right below here.

So this document is, must read. If you want to correct this particular examination, you must read this document or you must read this document before you start even preparing for this medical examination. Okay. Now advanced orchestrator function. So the same, how to work with the orchestrator cues and assets.

Environment applications and the do so again, you should have minimal qualified candidate should be comfortable with working with the following environments, such as software development, lifecycle, Microsoft Excel, Microsoft office suit, decent, an XML document. VDC sharp visual studio is option. Okay. So also virtual machines, VM PRPs browsers with page elements, version control.

So if you're not working on, that's not a problem, it's fine, but still prepare some questions.  get some notice about it. You have about studio RFM work and your mom, or just things I think, I mean degrading, but this is the most important part. What you should be trained on before you even apply or even start working for this advanced RPA is a mission.

So you should have RPS a starter course. I gave him the vision. The RP element of foundation are to be delivered at advance learning foundation, which Academy, if you go there and learning by whom you can find it a bit pretty easily, that RP a deliberate foundation.  okay. Then. Introduction to log-in course.

Okay. So logging mechanism, you should know about locking mechanism in book muttered in book core courses. Okay. Automation, motion, controlling systems, such as pit PFS, SVN. You should know about that. And other self learning sources that go to the subjects in the documents right now, what is the hands-on experience you need in order to appear for this examination?

So. It involves end to end process development perform. If you're involved in end to end, uh, development process that you have to give it for this particular example, you can give this . So this is the hands on experience it's needed. At least performing UI path code, review of your peers, uh, providing project support, hypercare support, production support.

If you are in a production support, we can, that that's considered as a hands-on experience. Providing maintenance and support, creating and reviewing product specifications, debugging, and fixing production bugs. So you, you should know about debugging, the production bugs, fixing the works, adding features to existing automating processes.

So these are all the things that are good to have as a hands on experience. If you want to appear for this examination, that's sort of must, that's not mandated, but these are good to have hands on experience, certain points. Okay. Then you go ahead. And once you complete all this pandemic, there's all this previous trainings, hands on experience, then go for RPA practice tests.

I've been a little bit back stairs. Also. You can find this video, which I have uploaded on my YouTube channel long time back, which is about. How do  examination, practice test. This is not, I'm not leading anything. So you have a please don't ban this video. Okay. So this is about how to crack the RP deliberate practice test in the practice test.

What types of questions would be asked? And I have unsettled discussions and I have explained in detail the functions and what, what perspective you should think about. And I scored 98% in the practice examination period. So once you at least achieve more than 80%, more than 80 to 90%, then you are confident enough to appear for such examination because it's going to be very enough, believe me to it enough.

Okay. And then finally, the exam details they have mentioned here. So the examination, the certification track is about certified professional advanced RPA developer, UI ERD. And it's exam one 20 minutes, right? Uh, 70% is a passing score and example is $200 for the RP associate exam fee is one $50. Uh, so, so it depends on which one you can attend also.

Um, you know, peer educators, they have mentioned here, uh, do not a predict visit. You have a certified associates. Developer is strongly recommended for those who are interested in Y E R D. So first examination, which is a one $50, which is the associate examination is strongly recommended if you want to appear for

But if you don't have that certification, that's also okay, because it's not a mandatory, so they have mentioned that though, it's not a predictable, it's mandatory, but it's strongly recommended so that you at least know that you can track that exam. So you can definitely can. Okay. If you have the enough knowledge.

So that's all about the RP associate examination and RP advanced examination on their learning or on the, on the learning certification page. You can definitely find here the black disc test for that. Okay. So you can find it in the practice just for associate exam like this, just for the . Okay. So you can go ahead and practice both of these exams and then.

Come back to academia. So coming back to academia, I just wanted to tell you that there are so many courses available. There are so many things which are new, but Academie now, if you are to start on, if you had official, if you want to start your career in RPA and you don't know how to start, when to start, where to start.

Right? So first thing you search start is RPA. When was that? I'd be a  in the RPS type thing. You should, first of all, get cited and fail. Okay. The cruises, that's my natural process. So in the courses, if you go to the category, if you see RPA starter, so first of all, complete RP cycle, of course, which is afforded us, which is the theoretical back, because it's not a practical course.

Okay. Basically it goes, but this will give you idea about what is RPU right. If you are a stipend, I'm just telling you, if you have to start, if you're a fresher. So, so complete this course, then come to learn in my room in the learning Bible, complete your RPA deliberate foundation, which is 39 hours. Of course then complete  okay to be delicate foundation course.

Then I'll pay a little bit upon scores, then complete. If you want to learn further, then go ahead and, uh, you know, start learning the. Business and industry groups. You cannot anytime done business Saturday schools, because that is always helpful. And then if you want to learn more versus then go for courses by category and you can independence, you can be at some other courses, trainings from here in my dashboard, you can see the achievements.

So once you complete certifications, you can see all your achievements like this. You can see there are so many, uh, but you can also download it from here, which downloads like a PDF. Got this. So once you complete any of the training, you get the certification limitless, which looks pretty much awesome.

Right? You can put it on your resume. You can put it. Yeah, I'm fine. This is good to have. So these are the basic diplomas you must have. So I couldn't, so that's all about it. And B, we wanted to talk to you about more about that certification because so many people are asking me this question and they wanted to make it.

We're going to clarify venue should appear for you iPod certified RPA associate, or I'll be assistant certificate. And when you should add we're Elizabeth at advanced ESL. So I hope, you know, have a clarified state of mind. You are not completely clear with the parts and you're ready to go for the certification.

So let me know in the comment section, if this video has helped you a lot and let me know. Well, you know, if you have a beautiful examination, if you want a before examination, if you have started after watching this particular video in the comment section, that would be more helpful for me. Thank you so much and see you soon on my YouTube video.

Again, with some, another tutorial, have a good day.
