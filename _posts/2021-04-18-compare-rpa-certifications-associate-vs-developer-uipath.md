## UiPath RPA Certifications Compared

Many people have been asking us about the difference between the UiPath Developer and Associate and certification exams, and which RPA certification they should persue.

We were going to put together a RPA Developer vs Associate comparison video of our own, but didn't think we could do much better than Nisarg Kadam's handling of the topic. 

If you are trying to figure out how to choose between Associate and Developer UiPath Certifications, watch Nisarg's video, take note of the Developer vs Associate comparison chart below, and figure out what type of RPA role you'd like to pursue. Put it all together, and which UiPath Certification to choose should be come clear.

### UiPath Exam Prerequisites

Many developers looking to get RPA Certified wonder about the prerequisites. 

The good news? There are none. You do not have to pass any prior exam, or take any required training, in order to register for either the UiPath Associate or UiPath Developer certifications. Experience with the tool, a good number of UiPath Acadamy courses are recommended, and lots of practice taking <a href="https://www.rpacertified.com/cert-questions-answers.html">UiPath Exam Practice tests</a> is needed. But other than going through a good <a href="https://www.rpacertified.com/study-guide-uipath.html">UiPath Study Guide</a> and getting lots of practice, there are no UiPath Exam Prerequisites.



### UiPath Certification Project

Many RPA Certifications seekers also ask if they need to complete and submit a UiPath Project. In previous versions, a Uipath Certification Project was required, but it is not anymore. So you can rest easy on this front.

### Is the UiPath Exam Multiple Choice?

There are no hands on labs or written answers on the UiPath Developer or Associate exams. The exams are composed exclusively of multiple choice questions.

### What is the UiPath Exam passing score?

This is one place where the UiPath Developer and Associate comparison comes up the same. Both RPA exams require a passing score of 70%. So you can get 3 out of every 10 test questions wrong and you'll still get RPA Certified.

### How long is the UiPath Exam?

The time given to the UiPath Associate and Developer exams are different. 

The UiPath Associate exam is 90 minutes long, while in comparison, the Developer exam is 120.
