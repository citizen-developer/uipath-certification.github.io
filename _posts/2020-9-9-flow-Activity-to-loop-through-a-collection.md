Question:  Which activity can you use if you want to loop through a collection of items?

 - [ ] &nbsp;  If
 - [ ] &nbsp;  Assign
 - [X] &nbsp;  For Each
 - [ ] &nbsp;  Flow Decision

## Answer

Option C is correct.

If directs the logic of the workflow.  Best used for two decision points.  Assign will give the value of a statement to a variable.  Flow Decision is like an if statement but found in Flowcharts.  For Each is a loop structure to can go through a collection of items.
