Question:  A developer wants to move the current version of a project onto the remote repository in order to collaborate with other developers. Which GIT command should be used to perform this action?

 - [X] &nbsp;  Push
 - [ ] &nbsp;  Commit
 - [ ] &nbsp;  Check In
 - [ ] &nbsp;  Pull

## Answer

Option A is correct.

That answer is A.  If you want to download the application, you would Pull the info.  If you want to save changes you have made to a checked out version, you would commit the changes.  If you have checked out a version, you will check it back in.  If you want to move a current version of a code to replace the previous version, you would use the Push command.
