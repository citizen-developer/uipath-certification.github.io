Question:  Which function does the Anchor Base activity provide?

 - [X] &nbsp;  Searches for a UI element by using other UI elements as anchors and searching the specified area around the anchored element
 - [ ] &nbsp;  Confirms the selector for the element is "True" based on a nearby anchored element
 - [ ] &nbsp;  Searches for a UI element by attaching to a reliable selector field and sending the tab hotkey until it is in the desired field
 - [ ] &nbsp;  Confirms the page is fully loaded, all elements are in the same place as where the automation was developed, and it matches the selector

## Answer

Option A is correct.

When there isnâ€™t a reliable selector available, an Anchor is useful so you can search for other UI Elements around it.
